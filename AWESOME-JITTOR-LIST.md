# Awesome Jittor List



- [JittorLLMs](https://github.com/Jittor/JittorLLMs): With the release of ChatGPT, large language models have been evolving rapidly. While many excellent LLM projects have emerged in China, the high hardware requirements and complex environments can be a barrier. Led by Feishi Technology and co-developed with the Visual Media Research Center at Tsinghua University, JittorLLMs is an LLM inference library intended to provide software and hardware support for LLM research. ![Thumbnail](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jittor/images/download/jittorllms-0.jpg)
- [GAN](https://github.com/Jittor/gan-jittor): The Jittor GAN model zoo includes 27 mainstream GAN models from 2014 to 2019.
